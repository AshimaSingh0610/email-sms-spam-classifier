# Email and SMS Spam Classifier

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify emails and SMS messages as either spam or non-spam (ham). Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the classifier analyzes the content of messages to accurately distinguish between legitimate and unwanted communications.




## Key Features

- Utilizes state-of-the-art NLP algorithms for text classification.
- Supports classification of both emails and SMS messages.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.


## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
- Streamlit (for the user interface)
## How to use

- Input an email or SMS message into the classifier.
- The model will analyze the content and predict whether it is spam or not.
- Users can take appropriate action based on the classification results.
